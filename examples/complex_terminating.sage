# Terminating Example.
# The reason is that for all i we have that either a_i or b_i is not a positive real.

# Matrix C
c = sage.all.Matrix(sage.all.QQbar,[[1,1,1,1]])

# Matrix A
a = sage.all.Matrix(sage.all.QQbar,[[5,-2,-4,4],[1,5,-2,-4],[2,-2,-1,4],[1,2,-2,-1]])

# Matrix B
b = sage.all.Matrix(sage.all.QQbar,[[0,-2,2,2],[2,0,-2,2],[-1,-1,3,1],[1,-1,-1,3]])

# Probability p
p = sage.all.QQ(1/2)
